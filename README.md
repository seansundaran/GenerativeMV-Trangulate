# GenerativeMV-Trangulate

-The title of my Generative Music Video will be called Trangulate, for reasons being that the song is called Trangulate.

-The generative portion of my art will be audio reactive. Mainly to the kick of the song.

-I was very inspired by a video I came across called Visualising Sound by Joelle. (https://vimeo.com/68161863)

-Here's an example of what I would like to include in my sketch (https://s23.postimg.org/6w551jzbv/170314_111454_570.png)(Sean)(https://s14.postimg.org/6mrjswp6p/Screen_Shot_2017_03_14_at_11_33_23_AM.png)(Sean)(https://s24.postimg.org/osd0yr7ed/P_2_2_3_02.png)(GenerativeGestaltung)

-The soundtrack would approximately 2min 30secs

-I will be going for the category B (camera reactive, audio reactive, shaders)
